    "# Ambulance Route & Hospital Optimization System\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "This project explores an ML-driven decision system for emergency medical services (EMS) that jointly optimizes ambulance routing and hospital selection. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than routing patients to the nearest hospital by distance alone, the system incorporates:\n",
    "- Travel time estimation\n",
    "- Hospital congestion and capacity\n",
    "- Patient severity and urgency\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize effective treatment delay while respecting real-world operational constraints."

    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Emergency medical routing is a multi-objective decision problem. While navigation systems can optimize for shortest travel time, they do not account for downstream delays caused by hospital congestion or varying clinical urgency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transporting a critically injured patient to a congested hospital may increase time-to-treatment, while transporting a stable patient to a distant hospital may unnecessarily increase risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to design a severity-aware optimization system that recommends the best hospital and route for an ambulance by balancing:\n",
    "- Estimated travel time\n",
    "- Predicted hospital wait time\n",
    "- Hospital congestion risk\n",
    "- Patient severity"

    "- Severity-aware optimization logic\n",
    "- Geospatial routing and visualization\n",

    "### Excluded:\n",
    "- Real-time EMS or 911 data\n",
    "- Live traffic feeds\n",
    "- Clinical decision-making or diagnosis\n",
    "- Production deployment or API services\n"

    "## Key Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Hospital congestion patterns can be reasonably approximated using historical and simulated data.\n",
    "- Travel time estimates based on road networks and time-of-day adjustments are sufficient for relative comparison.\n",
    "- Patient severity can be represented on a discrete ordinal scale (1–5).\n",
    "- Hospitals may prioritize critically ill patients even under high load.\n"
